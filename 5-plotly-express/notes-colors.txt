The first Plotly Choropleth example uses:
color_continuous_scale called 'Viridis'
and a range_color=(0,12)

Color lists can be discrete or continuous.

We can supply a color list:

cL = ['yellow','red',"rgb(195, 195, 195)"]

The last is a light gray.  The order corresponds to the order of values in the 'values' variable.  In this case, the first value is '1' (Alabama) has 0.02 < st < 0.03.  The next different one is '2'.

Available named colors are here:
https://community.plotly.com/t/plotly-colours-list/11730/2

including CSS colors, other defaults are:

    '#1f77b4',  # muted blue
    '#ff7f0e',  # safety orange
    '#2ca02c',  # cooked asparagus green
    '#d62728',  # brick red
    '#9467bd',  # muted purple
    '#8c564b',  # chestnut brown
    '#e377c2',  # raspberry yogurt pink
    '#7f7f7f',  # middle gray
    '#bcbd22',  # curry yellow-green
    '#17becf'   # blue-teal

For continuous, numeric data points are converted to values in the range [0,1] using range_color for the bounds, and then colors are interpolated.

"Most Plotly Express functions accept a color argument which automatically assigns data values to continuous color if the data is numeric. If the data contains strings, the color will automatically be considered discrete (also known as categorical or qualitative)."

"This means that numeric strings must be parsed to be used for continuous color, and conversely, numbers used as category codes must be converted to strings."

The continuous colors are in px.colors.sequential.  There are many.

There are also diverging and cyclic color scales.

px.colors.diverging.BrBG

Set the midpoint for a diverging scale with

color_continuous_midpoint=some_value

Any color scale can be reversed by adding '_r' to the name.

Custom scales can be constructed by

color_continuous_scale=[(0, "red"), (0.5, "green"), (1, "blue")])

Here is how to construct a discrete scale.

color_continuous_scale=[
    (0.00, "red"),   (0.33, "red"),
    (0.33, "green"), (0.66, "green"),
    (0.66, "blue"),  (1.00, "blue")])
