original data is in this file:
tl_2019_us_primaryroads.zip

from this directory:

python3 all_roads.py > ~/Desktop/all_roads.txt

takes 10-15 seconds

a diff shows that all_roads.txt produced today is 
not the same as that produced May 15, 5 days ago

but the change appears to be limited to distances
I don't remember modifying utils.dist code but I guess maybe I did

I think I see the difference in utils.dist
Now we compute the cosine of the latitude of the first point
I think previously we just used 38 degrees for all
Obviously, that would cause small changes to distances

In the end, I decided to drop the distance calc for this script.
