I completely rewrote the script to calculate
Albers spherical and ellipsoid projections
using the standard US reference latitudes 29.5 and 45.5
and centroid -96.0 23.0

I get the same answers
There were a couple typos in the old write-up

The q formula is tricky
The leading term (1 - e^2) multiplies the whole rest of the formula

The main question I have is why the units are so different for ellipsoid v. spherical

The new script is better annotated, I think.  It is called Albers.py.
