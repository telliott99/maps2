GeoJSON organizes geo data
It's just json:  dicts and arrays, etc.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON
A GeoJSON FeatureCollection has Features

A Feature has type, geometry, properties keys
geometry has type, coordinates keys

Here is a GeoJSON geometry of type Polygon

"geometry": {
  "type": "Polygon",

  "coordinates": [
      [
        [100.0, 0.0],
        [101.0, 0.0],
        [101.0, 1.0],
        [100.0, 1.0],
        [100.0, 0.0]
      ]
    ]

Note the double brackets.
If we had a reference to this feature as f
we might do

f['geometry']['coordinates'] 
to access the coordinates

An example is extract_counties.py
(next section)

There are various ways to work with JSON data
json module

'wiki_example.json'
doesn't work with json, not sure why yet

in my old stuff I got GeoJSON files from:
https://eric.clst.org/tech/usgeojson/

which he got by converting shapefiles
one of the official file types
