(note: changed dist function so these distances may also change when re-run)
and so may sorted order

two conclusions this morning

1
I can solve the wrong way problem by keeping track of *all* the points accumulated so far.  i.e. all the points for each waypoint.

Then check each new segment to see if the endpoint is in the list, already been used.

2
However I also realized that I'm going to go over the route by hand anyway.  I can see when we get turned around, and manually pick the next segment to use.

So I changed trace-route to start with the route plus the index of the first segment.  That way I can re-start in the middle.

Seems to work fine (see I-5-analysis.txt).

So, the finished product is I-5-route.txt.
