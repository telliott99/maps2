so how do we tell if we've turned around?
 
we have a match like t_eq_p (equal or close_enough)
which we hope is

s <------> t
           p <---------> q

but q for the new segment lies backward

s <------> t
     q <-- p

or 

      s <------> t
q <------------- p


either q is between s and t
or     s is between q and p

but looking at the I-5 problem area
segments covering the same ground may have different points

so we can't just ask:  is s in p..q or q in s..t

what to do?

- use a bbox
- compute the direction p -> q and compare with s -> t

in_bbox(t,p,q):
    def swap(a,b):
        return (b,a)
    x1,y1 = p
    x2,y2 = q
    if x1 > x2:
        x1,x2 = swap(x1,x2)
    if y1 > y2:
        y1,y2 = swap(y1,y2)
    x,y = t
    if x1 < x < x2:
        if y1 < y < y2:
            return True 
    return False
