We want to analyze what trace-route.py has given us for each target.

We should have one for

I-5 turns around
I-10 good
I-15 breaks early
I-25 good
I-40 good
I-70 turns around in St. Louis
I-80 turns around in Chicago and returns to Portland
I-84 good

Trim I-70 and I-80 by hand.

I-5 has always been a problem and that's still true.  Startpoint is
4r gets me to 0r but then it turns around
Find 92 by eye and then it goes the rest of the way

I-15 goes 3 segments to 0 and then finds 1r coming back
find 2 by eye
what happened?

<------------0------------>
  <----------1------------>
                           <-------------2
that's the sort of data that causes problems

search starting with 2 finds the end

Trying to extend this to US Highway 101
I don't think it's going to work.
The pieces are too small.
Maybe sort the segments by endpoints and then pick by hand?
