I went back to re-run the initial data analysis

all_roads.py
extract.py
endpoints.py

b/c I changed the dist function, the results are slightly different
in particular, the order of some of the segments is different for at least some highways.

I did not re-run trace-route1.py and trace-route2.py

I am starting here.

Go back and generate the I-10.txt and I-10-ends.txt for each of the 8 interstates.
Put it into data-interstates.

5 10 15 25 40 70 80 84

Now:

python3 trace-route.py I-10

First I must edit first-segments.txt
b/c order of segments has changed for some

I-5  4r
I-10 115r
I-15 16
I-25 12
I-40 1
I-70 153
I-80 227
I-84 13

plus
I-5 NS 65
I-5 second leg 93

---------

We want to analyze what trace-route.py has given us for each target.

We should have one for

I-5 turns around
I-10 good
I-15 breaks early
I-25 good
I-40 good
I-70 turns around in St. Louis
I-80 turns around in Chicago and returns to Portland
I-84 good

Trim I-70 and I-80 by hand.

I-5 has always been a problem and that's still true.  Startpoint is
4r gets me to 0r but then it turns around
Find 92 by eye and then it goes the rest of the way

I-15 goes 3 segments to 0 and then finds 1r coming back
find 2 by eye
what happened?

<------------0------------>
  <----------1------------>
                           <-------------2
that's the sort of data that causes problems

search starting with 2 finds the end
