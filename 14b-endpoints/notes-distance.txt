Distance formula.
1 degree of latitude is always 69 miles (neglect ellipsoid)
1 min of latitude is about 1 mile

1 degree of longitude depends on the latitude.
equal at the equator, -> 0 at the pole
standard answer
https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-much-distance-does-a-degree-minute-and-second-cover-your-maps#:~:text=One%20degree%20of%20latitude%20equals,one%20second%20equals%2080%20feet.
at 38 deg LAT, 1 deg LON equals 54.6 miles
1 min is a little less than 1 mile 

>>> from math import cos, radians
>>> f = cos(radians(38))
>>> f
0.7880107536067219
>>> f * 69
54.37274199886381
>>> 

I later modified this to use the cosine of the first point passed in
