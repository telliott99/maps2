b/c it's so large I do not have all_roads.txt saved in Dropbox
use it from the Desktop

cd /Users/telliott/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Github/maps2/14b-endpoints


there's 
changed the name to all_roads.orig.txt (also all_roads.new.txt)

python3 extract.py I-10

Can also write just the endpoints:

python3 endpoints.py I-10

-----

diff shows there *are* small chanes, not just in distances
the order of segments has changed in a few places 
(b/c they were sorted by distance)
I guess it's OK

-----

I've gone back and re-extracted everything yesterday.
Extending to US Highways

-----

in the old stuff

I wrote a second script to explore one interstate, I-10.
exploreOne.py

It filters endpoints.txt for I-10 segments
then computes the distance covered by each
doing a rough adjustment for longitude variation.

The results are a bit of a mess.
Some are really short, some are super long.
Anywhere between 2-2000 points or so.

I've revised things a bit so I'm repeating the analysis.
The segments are already sorted by size.

I checked out one that starts just east of Centennial AZ
and extends west to the California border at -114.5308

According to Google that's about 70 miles.
It has 617 points:

8
-113.335, 33.566
-114.5308, 33.6046
617
64.6276

There's another one almost exactly the same endpoints.

9
-113.3351, 33.5665
-114.5307, 33.6048
662
64.6198

There are two others ending at/near the CA-AZ border

0
-117.0652, 34.0039
-114.5308, 33.6046
1434
139.5991

1
-117.0649, 34.0039
-114.5307, 33.6048
2277
139.5874

These end at the California border
coming from the other direction

starting in Calimesa, CA

According to Google that's about 150 miles.
It has almost 2300 points.

This is the largest one.

There are 372 LineStrings.
That's perhaps 20000 points.
for about 2431 miles.

About 10x what I really need

So now what?

----

How to combine all the LineStrings
Reducing the data set

First problem?
Are there overlaps?
That's hard ... lots of little pieces
in places, within a group with a W direction
the direction may change briefly to E
