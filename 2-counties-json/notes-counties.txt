I obtained county GeoJSON data from the plotly github repo
using a URL given in their write-up, and saved it to disk for reuse.

I don't have a note of what the original URL was.
But I found some docs here:

https://plotly.com/python/map-configuration/

I suspect this is the URL
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/geojson-counties-fips.json

referenced from this page
https://plotly.com/python/choropleth-maps/

diff gives 0 changes so yes

----

The Python json module can load this file and parse into dicts, etc.

I wrote a script read-counties.py
that can produce plain text from the data.

The result is in counties.txt.

The state_data.py file contains FIPS numbers for the states and territories.  There's more in the covid project.
