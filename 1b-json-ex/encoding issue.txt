importing GeoJSON US counties including Puerto Rico
ran into problems b/c it was not encoded as UTF-8

# got GeoJSON counties from another source to check

# invalid utf-8 for '72045' Comer_o, Puerto Rico
# Puerto Rico municipios

# found the site of the error by loading binary and 
# searching on the index of the error

This can be fixed by

fn = 'data/geojson-counties-fips.json'

try:
    fh = open(fn,'r')
    counties = json.load(fh)
  
except UnicodeDecodeError:
    fh = open(fn,'rb')
    s = fh.read()
    data = s.decode('ISO-8859-1')
    tmp = open('.tmp','w')
    tmp.write(data)
    fh = open('.tmp','r')
    counties = json.load(fh)
