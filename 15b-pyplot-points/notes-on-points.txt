combine.py
gets all the points from all the features
sets precision to 2 digits
removes dupes

there are 4676 points
with precision = 1 there were about 400

The trace looks reasonable
endpoints are correct

Add the filter code into combine2.py

Next steps:

- get LON/LAT for waypoints
- write code to filter I data for waypoints
- figure out how to project correctly
- figure out how to add geojson as a plotly layer

- do this for all "my" interstates
