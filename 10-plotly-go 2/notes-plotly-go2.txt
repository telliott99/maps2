The first version is missing LA county and also Ventura, San Francisco and one more.
b/c MultiPolygons weren't handled correctly in making the data file.

counties.lg.json
take read-counties2.py and change input

python3 read-counties.py > counties.lg.geo.txt

must also modify to deal with UnicodeDecodeError
that works

however, noticed Alabama is missing counties in the .json files??

and counties are still missing in California!
