truncated I-10 at El Paso.
Plot looks good!

However, when I plot I-5, something bad happens.

The problem is that before I was scattering points and order didn't matter.

They were sorted into an order which is not the way they occur in original data.

Now with plotly I've been drawing lines.

Two adjacent points like
-123.37,43.19
-123.36,42.48

make a fat vertical line
